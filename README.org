** Building

   Personally I'm using Android Studio, it makes things easier.

   Otherwise:
   - ~./gradlew clean build~
   - ~./gradlew connectedAndroidTest~ is how you can run tests on
     emulator/device. 

     There's more on [[https://developer.android.com/studio/test/command-line.html][Test from the Command Line]].
     I guess above and [[http://goo.gl/qVu1yV][mentioning to turn off animations]] should be enough for start.
   - ~./gradlew assemble~ [[https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline.html][builds]] all APKs
